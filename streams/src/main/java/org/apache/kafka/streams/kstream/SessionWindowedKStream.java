/**
 * {@code SessionWindowedKStream} is an abstraction of a <em>windowed</em> record stream of {@link Record key-value} pairs.
 * It is an intermediate representation of a {@link KStream}, that is aggregated into a windowed {@link KTable}
 * (a <em>windowed</em> {@link KTable} is a {@link KTable} with key type {@link Windowed Windowed<K>}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code SessionWindowedKStream} represents a {@link SessionWindows session window} type.
 *
 * <p>The result is written into a local {@link SessionStore} (which is basically an ever-updating
 * materialized view) that can be queried using the name provided in the {@link Materialized} instance.
 * Furthermore, updates to the store are sent downstream into a windowed {@link KTable} changelog stream, where
 * "windowed" implies that the {@link KTable} key is a combined key of the original record key and a window ID.
 * New events are added to {@link SessionWindows} until their grace period ends
 * (see {@link SessionWindows#ofInactivityGapAndGrace(Duration, Duration)}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code SessionWindowedKStream} is obtained from a {@link KStream} by {@link KStream#groupByKey() grouping} and
 * {@link KGroupedStream#windowedBy(SessionWindows) windowing}.
 *
 * @param <K> the key type of this session-windowed stream
 * @param <V> the value type of this session-windowed stream
